# MiniAppApp

MiniAppApp is an iOS project that showcases two types of mini-apps: Dice and Counter. These mini-apps are designed to be embedded in a table view, with each mini-app having its own unique interactions and a full-screen view.

- The table view cells are fully interactive, allowing users to expand and collapse the mini-apps directly within the app.
